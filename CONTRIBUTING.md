# Thanks for contributing to the Clipboard Project! ðŸ‘‹

We are always accepting new contributions, whether it's code, documentation, or something else. 

## Guidelines for your valuable contributions


- Try to keep unrelated additions/modifications in seperate PRs so that they're each easier to think about and take action upon.

- Make sure you format your code using our formatting scripts, and run the test suite.
